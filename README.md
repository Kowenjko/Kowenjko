## Hi there 👋

Frontend Developer with 3 years of commercial experience, primarily focused on Vue 3 / Nuxt 3. I build high-performance, scalable web applications with clean architecture, strong UI/UX, and reliable API integration. Experienced in working with both product teams and international clients.

I also have commercial experience working with React / Next.js, and practical experience with partial fullstack development, including backend APIs and services using Python (FastAPI, Django) and Node.js.
