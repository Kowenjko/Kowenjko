## Hi there 👋

Frontend Developer with 4+ years of commercial experience, primarily focused on Vue 3 / Nuxt 3. I build high-performance, scalable web applications with clean architecture, strong UI/UX, and reliable API integration. Experienced in working with both product teams and international clients.

In addition to frontend, I have practical experience with partial fullstack development, including backend APIs and services using Python (FastAPI, Django) and Node.js. Proactive team player, comfortable in cross-functional teams, and focused on delivering real business value.
